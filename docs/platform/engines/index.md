# Engines

## Introduction

The `codbex` platform comes equipped with a set of built-in engines that enhance the development and execution of applications. Each engine serves a specific purpose, providing developers with a comprehensive platform to build a wide range of applications. This documentation provides an overview of the key built-in engines in the platform.

### [JavaScript Engine](./javascript/)

The JavaScript engine in the `codbex` platform allows developers to write server-side scripts using the JavaScript language. This engine supports the latest ECMAScript standards, including ES6 syntax. Developers can create APIs, business logic, and data services using JavaScript.

### [TypeScript Engine](./typescript/)

The platform supports TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript. The TypeScript engine allows developers to write and transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript, providing strong typing and improved code maintainability.

### [Python Engine](./python/)

The Python engine enables developers to write server-side scripts and applications using the Python programming language. It includes a Python runtime, allowing developers to leverage the extensive Python ecosystem for various functionalities.

### [Command Engine](./command/)

The Command engine in the `codbex` platform provides integration with variuos a command-line interfaces (CLI) for interacting with the underlying platform. Developers can use commands to perform various tasks, such as managing artefacts, deploying applications, and configuring the runtime environment.

### [Jobs Engine](./jobs/)

The Jobs engine allows developers to schedule and manage background jobs within the `codbex` platform. It supports the execution of recurring tasks, data processing, and automation of various processes.

### [Listeners Engine](./listeners/)

The Listeners engine enables developers to create event-driven applications by setting up listeners for specific events. It supports various event types, including database changes, file system events, and custom triggers.

### [Web Engine](./web/)

Web engine provides a framework for managing the front-end parts of the web applications at runtime.

### [Wiki Engine](./wiki/)

The Wiki engine allows developers to create and manage documentation, project wikis, and collaborative content within the platform. It provides a user-friendly interface for content creation and editing.

### [WebSockets Engine](./websockets/)

The WebSockets engine enables real-time communication between the server and clients. Developers can use WebSockets to build interactive and responsive applications with bidirectional communication.

### [Security Engine](./security/)

The Security engine in the `codbex` platform provides features for securing applications, including user authentication, authorization, and role-based access control. It ensures the protection of sensitive data and resources.

### [OpenAPI Engine](./openapi/)

The OpenAPI engine facilitates the creation and documentation of RESTful APIs. Developers can define API specifications using the OpenAPI standard, and the engine generates API documentation automatically.

### [OData Engine](./odata/)

The `codbex` platform includes an OData engine for building and consuming OData services. It simplifies data integration and allows developers to expose data as OData endpoints or consume external OData services.

### [CMS (Content Management System) Engine](./cms/)

The CMS engine provides a content management system for organizing and managing various content types, such as documents, images, and multimedia files.

### [BPM (Business Process Management) Engine](./bpm/)

The BPM engine enables the design, execution, and monitoring of business processes within the platform. Developers can model and automate business workflows for improved efficiency.

### [Integrations Engine](./integrations/)

The Integrations engine supports the integration of external systems and services. Developers can create connectors, adapters, and integration flows to connect the `codbex` platform with other applications.

### [FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Engine](./ftp/)

The FTP engine allows developers to implement FTP-based file transfer functionality within the platform. It supports secure and efficient file exchange between systems.

### [SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) Engine](./sftp/)

The SFTP engine provides secure file transfer capabilities using the SSH protocol. It ensures the encrypted and secure exchange of files between systems.

## Conclusion

The `codbex` platform built-in engines offer a comprehensive set of tools and capabilities for developers to build diverse applications. Whether it's scripting with JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python, managing background jobs, setting up event listeners, building web applications, securing resources, or integrating with external systems, `codbex` provides a unified platform for end-to-end application development.
